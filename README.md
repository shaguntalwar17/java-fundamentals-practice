# Java Fundamentals Practice

This repository documents my Java learning journey where I practiced
core Java programming concepts through basic coding exercises and
small beginner-level projects.

The purpose of this repository is to build a strong foundation in Java
by focusing on logic building, problem solving and understanding how
Java programs are structured.
